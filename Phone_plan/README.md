#Determination of a promising tariff for a telecom company

## Data

Five files provided by the customer:
- users (data of 500 customer users: who they are, where they are from, what tariff is used),
- tariffs (data on customer tariff plans),
- calls (information about calls made by users during the year),
- Internet (data on user traffic for the same period),
- messages (information about SMS sent during the year.

## Task

It is necessary to analyze user behavior and determine which tariff (of the two existing ones) is more profitable from the companyâ€™s point of view.
To answer this question, two hypotheses were tested:

* there are average incomes of users of Ultra and Smart tariffs;
* The average revenue of users in Moscow differs from the revenue of users in other regions.

## libraries used

*pandas, scipy, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn*
